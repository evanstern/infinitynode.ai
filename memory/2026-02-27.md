## Setup work
- Installed Samba on vm-104, shared `/home/openclaw/.openclaw/workspace` as `[workspace]` over SMB (LAN only, port 445, 192.168.1.0/24)
- Evan mounted the share on his Mac and is using **Cursor IDE** to view/edit workspace files
- Connect: `smb://192.168.1.104/workspace`, user `openclaw`
- Discussed adding Anthropic API key — Evan has a Claude key to add. Steps: put `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `~/.openclaw/.env`, restart gateway, probe. Not yet done.
- Gateway runs as systemd service (confirmed via `openclaw status --json`)
- Evan notes Tailscale conflicts with his local `*.infinity-node.win` domains, so avoided tailnet for SMB
